# Machine Learning Regression 

## Logistic Regression 

Used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

Logistic Regression - used to predict categorical outcomes unlike linear regression that predicts a continuous outcome.


## Linear Regression 

Predicts the value of a variable based on the value of another variable

A Linear Regression model’s main aim is to find the best fit linear line and the optimal values of intercept and coefficients such that the error is minimized. 
Error is the difference between the actual value and Predicted value and the goal is to reduce this difference.

 `y = Bo + b1x`
