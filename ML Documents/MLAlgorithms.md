# Machine Learning Algorithms


## Logistic Regression 

Used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

Logistic Regression - used to predict categorical outcomes unlike linear regression that predicts a continuous outcome.

## Linear Regression 

Predicts the value of a variable based on the value of another variable

A Linear Regression model’s main aim is to find the best fit linear line and the optimal values of intercept and coefficients such that the error is minimized. 
Error is the difference between the actual value and Predicted value and the goal is to reduce this difference.

 `y = Bo + b1x`

## Multiple Regression 

Equation - bo is the intercept, b1,b2,b3,b4…, are coefficients or slopes of the independent variables x1,x2,x3,x4…,xn and y is the dependent variable.

### Decision Tree’s

A decision tree is a supervised machine-learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems

Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions

The Random Forest Algorithm combines the output of multiple (randomly created) Decision Trees to generate the final output.
