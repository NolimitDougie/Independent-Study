# Machine Learning Neural Networks

)

## Multilayer Perception 

Simplest Neural Network - composed of an input layer to receive the signal, an output layer that makes a decision or prediction about the input, and in between those two, an arbitrary number of hidden layers that are the true computational engine of the MLP.







## Convolution Neural Network 


This Neural Network is best to use for image classification.

Itâ€™s very good at picking up on patterns in the input image, such as lines, gradients, circles, or even eyes and faces. It is this property that makes convolutional neural networks so powerful for computer vision.


## Optimizing Techniques

### Exhaustive search

Exhaustive search, or brute-force search, is the process of looking for the most optimal hyperparameters by checking whether each candidate is a good match.

### Gradient descent
Gradient descent is the most common algorithm for model optimization for minimizing the error. In order to perform gradient descent, you have to iterate over the training dataset while re-adjusting the model.

`Mini-batch` gradient descent is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm that splits the training dataset into small batches that are used to calculate model error and update model coefficients
